-->

<!-- Semantic tags -->
<h1></h1> to <h6></h6>
<p></p>

<!-- Formatting tags -->
<b></b>     <i></i>     <u></u>
<s></s> -> strike
<br>    <hr>
<strong></strong>   -> always use 'strong' instead of 'b' tag as it emphasizes when content is converted from text to speech

<!-- 
    EMMET SHORTCUTS:
        p>h1 => paragraph ke andar h1   ['>' for indenting inside]
        p.cn => create para with class = cn

        </table>

        shortcut t generate above code using emmet:
            table>tr>td*2
-->


<!-- DIV TAG * * * -->
<!-- It's a generic container used to create divisions.
It is used for wrapping parts of code together. -->


<!-- 
    Block Elements: left se right ka saara space le lete hai
        Thus, hamesha next line mei create hota hai

    Inline Elements: Content ke hisab se space lete hai
-->



<!-- TABLES IN HTML -->
arrangement of data in cells (formed by combination of rows and columns)

Tags related to tables:
    <table></table> -> used to create a table
    <thead></thead> -> used to specify headings inside tables
    <tbody></tbody> -> used to specify body of table
    <tfoot></tfoot> -> used for footer and summarization
    <tr></tr>       -> creates row in table
    <td></td>       -> creates cell in that row
    <th></th>       -> creates headings in thead tag ( just like td is for tr, th is for thead)

* * * <td></td> has an attribute "colspan" and "rowspan" used to expand a cell vertically and horizontally.
rowspan = row khayega => thus, expands vertically
colspan = col khayega => thus, expands horizontally



<!-- FORMS IN HTML -->
used to take input from user

Tags related to forms:
    <form></form> -> used to create a form
    <input type="#"> -> used to take input
    ( input tag has an attribute "type" whose value can be specified to get certain type of input )
    <label for="!"></label> -> used to create a label for input
    * * always fill the for attribute of label tag with id of input tag for which it belongs.

    Placeholder: faded text that appears by default when the textbox is empty.
    it is a attribute in input tag and its value = text to be displayed.

Elements of HTML FORMS:
    <input type="#"> used to take input from user
    <select name="" id=""></select> used to create dropdown menu
    <option value=""></option> used to create options in that dropdown menu 
    (value attributes tells the val that would be registered if that option is selected)
    <textarea cols="30" rows="10"></textarea> used to create a multi-line textbox
    <fieldset></fieldset> used to group similar things together
    ( different from div as it has border and spacing by default and also allows to provide a caption)
    <legend></legend> used to provide that caption to fieldset

Values for type attribute of input tag:
    text (default)
    submit (creates submit button)
    radio (creates radio button)
    checkbox
    file (creates file selector)
    image (creates image button)
    date (date picker)
    password
    email
    tel



<!-- Media in HTML -->
<img src="source" alt="alt text if image is not loaded">
img tag has loading attribute whose value can either be set to 
    "eager"(default) -> to load img immediately
    "lazy" -> to load img when user scrolls web page near it
this helps in improve webpage load times and increasing performance

<audio src="sourceLocation"></audio>
BUT, just using above tag wont show audio file playback in webpage (must add controls attribute)
<audio src="sourceLocation" controls></audio>

<video src="sourceLocation" controls></video>

IFRAME * * IMP
used to embed external webpage to our website
<iframe src="referencePathOfOtherHTML" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Ex:
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oe7CF-TY_U" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Tip: Add "?autoplay=1&mute=1" at end of yt link to auto play muted video (0=false, 1=true) 



<!-- SEO AND HEAD TAG -->
Data inside head tag is NOT displayed in web page
generally contains SEO related data

<title></title> -> Adds title to document in brower's tab

favicon = icon shown in browers tab (emmet abbrevation: link:favicon )
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

linking css file: (emmet abb.: link:css )
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

linking Javascript file (emmet abb.: script:src )
<script src="brain.js"></script>

META tag play imp role in SEO (does not have closing tag)
<meta charset="UTF-8">
one of the popular character encoding used for majority of the websites as it supports multi lingual support.

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
bhide ke jamane mei, different version of browser used to render website differently
this tag makes the browser use latest render engine, to maintain uniformity

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
sets website width = device width and inital zoom to 100%

<meta name="description" content="abcd...">
sets value of content attribute as description for website (displayed in search results)

<meta name="keywords" content="kash, webd">
put keywords as comma separated values in content attribute. This keywords are used to rank website.

<meta name="author" content="kash04">
sets author of doc (so if someone searches for author then too web will rank)

<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
parameters:
    index: tells search engine to index webpage
    noindex: tells not to index the webpage
    follow: allow web crawlers/bots to follow links in webpage
    nofollow: doesnt allow crawlers
    
    For better SEO, most websites allow indexing and follow as it helps rank the content



<!-- CASCADING STYLE SHEET ( CSS ) -->
used to style skeleton/structure generated for our webpage using html
CSS could be added in 3 different ways
    -inline (specifying css in same line as html tag(using style attribute). not preffered as it makes code hard to read & modify)
    -internal (css added in head tag ke andar style tag)
    -external (css written in different file and linked to html. MOST COMMONLY USED)

CSS styling has 3 elements: selector, property and value
Ex: h1 { color: green }
    here, h1 is selector, used to select elements
        color is property whose value is going to be modified
        green is value that would be assigned to that property

* * IF same property is defined in both inline, external and internal css, inline would be given preference
    (though we could use !important after value to make it imp)


Types of selectors in CSS:
    element (tag ke naam se)
    h1 { color: red; }

    id
    #idName { color: red; }

    class
    .className { color: red; }

    group
    used to apply style to multiple items at once (selector names entered as comma separated)
    .className,p { color: red; }

    also, using element selector follow by '.' and className would style only items having both that element and class Name
    h1.class { color: red; }


<!-- CSS Typography -->
Typography = visual styling (fonts, colors, etc.)
<style>
    p{
        font-style: italic;
        font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    }
</style>
* * just write font and it would suggest properties related to it
font-family has 3 values, 
    actual font that is to be used(times new roman)
    if not present then use any font from family (times)
    if still not present then use a font of same type (serif)


* * Using custom fonts in our webpage
    fonts suggested by emmet on typing font-family are websafe fonts and are available in most of the browsers.
To use any other custom font:
    go to google fonts
    select font and weight
    copy link tag shown and paste in head tag (this would import the font to our webpage)


<!-- COLORS -->
colors in CSS can be used in different ways:
<style>
    p{
        background-color: yellow;
        /* named color */

        background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
        /* using rgb value */

        background-color: rgba(100, 109, 192, 0.5);
        /* using rgba (a=alpha, lies between 0 and 1, describes transparency) */

        background-color: #121212;
        /* using hex values */

        background-color: hsl(172, 27, 79);
        /* using HSL(hue, saturation, lightness) */
    }
</style>



<!-- CSS Box Model -->
* Everything on a webpage is made of boxes *
Relates CSS properties and their usage:
    border-style -> used to set style of border for given element
    border-width -> sets thickness of border
    border-color -> sets color of border

    * * short hand notation for borders:
        border: (type) (color) (width);
    ex: border: solid brown 3px;

    border-radius property is used to make rounded corners


We can use width and height property to specify height and width of element
(works only on block elements, thus wont work on inline element like span)
(so, if we have to give height and width to elements like span, first convert them to block)

In Box Model,
    Padding = distance between content and border
    margin = distance beside border that would be left empty
So, while moving from out to in:
    Margin -> border -> Padding -> Content

By default webpage has default margin for each element
    to remove this we could use 'Universal Selector'
    properties changed using this selector apply to all the content in the webpage
syntax:
    <style>
        *{
            /* properties to be changed here */
        }
        
    </style>

* * ' box-sizing ' Property:
    by default its value is 'content-box' but can be changed to 'border-box'
    content-box => width set using width property = content width
    border-box => width set = content width + padding + borderWidth (margin excluded!!)



<!-- CSS Display Property -->
Block Element:
    - includes tags like div, p, h1, etc.
    - hamesha new line par aate hai
    - default width = whole horizontal space of viewport
    - respect custom width and height given
    - respect custom margin and padding

Inline Element:
    - includes tags like a, span, etc.
    - same line mei aane ka try karte hai
    - width = content width
    - custom width and height CANNOT be applied
    - margin can be applied only in horizontal, not in vertical
    - padding works fine

Inline-block Property:
    - behaves same like inline, but allows us to set custom height and width
