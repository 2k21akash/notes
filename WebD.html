<!-- web = system made of interconnected documents spread across internet -->
<!-- web is a subset of internet -->
<!-- development = creating websites or web applications -->

<!-- 
    Web application is made of multiple layers
    - Frontend (visual appearance)
    - Backend (logic)
    - DB (data storage)
-->

<!-- 
    Network: multiple resources connected to each other
    Internet: Network of Networks
    WWW: aka web, system made of interconnected documents and resources
    IP: Unique address given to each device connected to internet for communicating
    Browser: Tool used to access websites, resources, docs and web applications over the internet
    Browser Engine: just like cpp needs compiler, web apps need browser engine
-->

<!-- 
    packets: data sent on internet is breaken down in smaller chunks know as packets

    Client computer must know the IP address of server to communicate with it.
    DNS: (Domain Name System) helps in resolving/converting domain names to IP Address.
    Protocol: set of rules used for communicating over internet

        p#cn => create para with id = cn

                <td></td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        shortcut t generate above code using emmet:
            table>tr>td*2
-->


<!-- DIV TAG * * * -->
<!-- It's a generic container used to create divisions.
It is used for wrapping parts of code together. -->


<!-- 
    Block Elements: left se right ka saara space le lete hai
        Thus, hamesha next line mei create hota hai

    Inline Elements: Content ke hisab se space lete hai
-->



<!-- TABLES IN HTML -->
arrangement of data in cells (formed by combination of rows and columns)

Tags related to tables:
    <table></table> -> used to create a table
    <thead></thead> -> used to specify headings inside tables
    <tbody></tbody> -> used to specify body of table
    <tfoot></tfoot> -> used for footer and summarization
    <tr></tr>       -> creates row in table
    <td></td>       -> creates cell in that row
    <th></th>       -> creates headings in thead tag ( just like td is for tr, th is for thead)

* * * <td></td> has an attribute "colspan" and "rowspan" used to expand a cell vertically and horizontally.
rowspan = row khayega => thus, expands vertically
colspan = col khayega => thus, expands horizontally



<!-- FORMS IN HTML -->
used to take input from user

Tags related to forms:
    <form></form> -> used to create a form
    <input type="#"> -> used to take input
    ( input tag has an attribute "type" whose value can be specified to get certain type of input )
    <label for="!"></label> -> used to create a label for input
    * * always fill the for attribute of label tag with id of input tag for which it belongs.

    Placeholder: faded text that appears by default when the textbox is empty.
    it is a attribute in input tag and its value = text to be displayed.

Elements of HTML FORMS:
    <input type="#"> used to take input from user
    <select name="" id=""></select> used to create dropdown menu
    <option value=""></option> used to create options in that dropdown menu 
    (value attributes tells the val that would be registered if that option is selected)
    <textarea cols="30" rows="10"></textarea> used to create a multi-line textbox
    <fieldset></fieldset> used to group similar things together
    ( different from div as it has border and spacing by default and also allows to provide a caption)
    <legend></legend> used to provide that caption to fieldset

Values for type attribute of input tag:
    text (default)
    submit (creates submit button)
    radio (creates radio button)
    checkbox
    file (creates file selector)
    image (creates image button)
    date (date picker)
    password
    email

<!-- Media in HTML -->
<img src="source" alt="alt text if image is not loaded">
img tag has loading attribute whose value can either be set to 
    "eager"(default) -> to load img immediately
    "lazy" -> to load img when user scrolls web page near it
this helps in improve webpage load times and increasing performance

<audio src="sourceLocation"></audio>
BUT, just using above tag wont show audio file playback in webpage (must add controls attribute)
<audio src="sourceLocation" controls></audio>

<video src="sourceLocation" controls></video>

IFRAME * * IMP
used to embed external webpage to our website
<iframe src="referencePathOfOtherHTML" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Ex:
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oe7CF-TY_U" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Tip: Add "?autoplay=1&mute=1" at end of yt link to auto play muted video (0=false, 1=true)
